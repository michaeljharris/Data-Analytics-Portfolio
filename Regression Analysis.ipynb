    "### Regression Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this workbook was to perform regression modelling on a dataset of information about European tech workers and attempt to predict their compensation based on their attributes and job positions. Most of this work involved the process of data exploration and preparation to ensure the data was in the correct form for regression modelling. I also performed feature selection to try and find the best features to use for modelling and then used grid searching to find the best hyperparameters. While the final results were not as conclusive as I was expecting, the process was still useful to understand how to prepare a complex and real life dataset.\n",
